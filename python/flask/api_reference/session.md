# Sessions {#sessions}

If you have set `Flask.secret_key` (or configured it from `SECRET_KEY`) you can use sessions in Flask applications. A session makes it possible to remember information from one request to another. The way Flask does this is by using a signed cookie. The user can look at the session contents, but canâ€™t modify it unless they know the secret key, so make sure to set that to something complex and unguessable.

To access the current session you can use the `session` object:

## `class` flask.session

The session object works pretty much like an ordinary dict, with the difference that it keeps track of modifications.

This is a proxy. See [Notes On Proxies](/python/flask/user_guide/request_context#notes-on-proxies) for more information.

The following attributes are interesting:

- ### new

    `True` if the session is new, `False` otherwise.

- ### modified

    `True` if the session object detected a modification. Be advised that modifications on mutable structures are not picked up automatically, in that situation you have to explicitly set the attribute to `True` yourself. Here an example:

    ```python
    # this change is not picked up because a mutable object (here
    # a list) is changed.
    session['objects'].append(42)
    # so mark it as modified yourself
    session.modified = True
    ```

- ### permanent

    If set to `True` the session lives for `permanent_session_lifetime` seconds. The default is `31` days. If set to `False` (which is the default) the session will be deleted when the user closes the browser.
