# Stream Helpers

## flask.stream_with_context(`generator_or_function`)

Request contexts disappear when the response is started on the server. This is done for efficiency reasons and to make it less likely to encounter memory leaks with badly written WSGI middlewares. The downside is that if you are using streamed responses, the generator cannot access request bound information any more.

This function however can help you keep the context around for longer:

```python
from flask import stream_with_context, request, Response

@app.route('/stream')
def streamed_response():
    @stream_with_context
    def generate():
        yield 'Hello '
        yield request.args['name']
        yield '!'
    return Response(generate())
```

Alternatively it can also be used around a specific generator:

```python
from flask import stream_with_context, request, Response

@app.route('/stream')
def streamed_response():
    def generate():
        yield 'Hello '
        yield request.args['name']
        yield '!'
    return Response(stream_with_context(generate()))
```
