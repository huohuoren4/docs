# Deprecations and Removals {#deprecations-and-removals}

This page lists all pytest features that are currently deprecated or have been removed in past major releases. The objective is to give users a clear rationale why a certain feature has been removed, and what alternatives should be used instead.

## Deprecated Features {#deprecated-features}

Below is a complete list of all pytest features which are considered deprecated. Using those features will issue [`PytestWarning`]() or subclasses, which can be filtered using [standard warning filters](/python/pytest/how_to_guides/warning#how-to-capture-warnings).

### Support for tests written for nose {#support-for-tests-written-for-nose}

*Deprecated since version 7.2.*

Support for running tests written for nose is now deprecated.

`nose` has been in maintenance mode-only for years, and maintaining the plugin is not trivial as it spills over the code base (see [issue #9886](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9886) for more details).

#### setup/teardown

One thing that might catch users by surprise is that plain `setup` and `teardown` methods are not pytest native, they are in fact part of the `nose` support.

```python
class Test:
    def setup(self):
        self.resource = make_resource()

    def teardown(self):
        self.resource.close()

    def test_foo(self):
        ...

    def test_bar(self):
        ...
```

Native pytest support uses `setup_method` and `teardown_method` (see [Method and function level setup/teardown](/python/pytest/how_to_guides/xunit#method-and-function-level-setup-teardown)), so the above should be changed to:

```python
class Test:
    def setup_method(self):
        self.resource = make_resource()

    def teardown_method(self):
        self.resource.close()

    def test_foo(self):
        ...

    def test_bar(self):
        ...
```

This is easy to do in an entire code base by doing a simple find/replace.

#### `@with_setup`

Code using `@with_setup` such as this:

```python
from nose.tools import with_setup


def setup_some_resource():
    ...


def teardown_some_resource():
    ...


@with_setup(setup_some_resource, teardown_some_resource)
def test_foo():
    ...
```

Will also need to be ported to a supported pytest style. One way to do it is using a fixture:

```python
import pytest


def setup_some_resource():
    ...


def teardown_some_resource():
    ...


@pytest.fixture
def some_resource():
    setup_some_resource()
    yield
    teardown_some_resource()


def test_foo(some_resource):
    ...
```

### The pytest.Instance collector {#the-pytest-instance-collector}

*Removed in version 7.0.*

The `pytest.Instance` collector type has been removed.

Previously, Python test methods were collected as `Class` -> `Instance` -> `Function`. Now `Class` collects the test methods directly.

Most plugins which reference `Instance` do so in order to ignore or skip it, using a check such as `if isinstance(node, Instance): return`. Such plugins should simply remove consideration of `Instance` on pytest>=7. However, to keep such uses working, a dummy type has been instanted in `pytest.Instance` and `_pytest.python.Instance`, and importing it emits a deprecation warning. This will be removed in pytest 8.

### `fspath` argument for `Node` constructors replaced with `pathlib.Path` {#fspath-argument-for-node-constructors-replaced-with-pathlib-path}

*Deprecated since version 7.0.*

In order to support the transition from `py.path.local` to `pathlib`, the `fspath` argument to `Node` constructors like `pytest.Function.from_parent()` and [`pytest.Class.from_parent()` is now deprecated.

Plugins which construct nodes should pass the `path` argument, of type `pathlib.Path`, instead of the `fspath` argument.

Plugins which implement custom items and collectors are encouraged to replace `fspath` parameters (`py.path.local`) with path parameters (`pathlib.Path`), and drop any other usage of the `py` library if possible.

If possible, plugins with custom items should use [cooperative constructors](/python/pytest/further_topics/deprecation#constructors-of-custom-pytest-node-subclasses-should-take-kwargs) to avoid hardcoding arguments they only pass on to the superclass.

::: tip Note
The name of the `Node` arguments and attributes (the new attribute being `path`) is the opposite of the situation for hooks, [outlined below](/python/pytest/further_topics/deprecation#configuring-hook-specs-impls-using-markers) (the old argument being `path`).

This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the py dependency (see [issue #9283](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9283) for a longer discussion).
:::

Due to the ongoing migration of methods like `reportinfo()` which still is expected to return a `py.path.local` object, nodes still have both `fspath` (`py.path.local`) and `path` (`pathlib.Path`) attributes, no matter what argument was used in the constructor. We expect to deprecate the `fspath` attribute in a future release.

### Configuring hook specs/impls using markers {#configuring-hook-specs-impls-using-markers}

Before pluggy, pytestâ€™s plugin library, was its own package and had a clear API, pytest just used `pytest.mark` to configure hooks.

The `pytest.hookimpl()` and `pytest.hookspec()` decorators have been available since years and should be used instead.

```python
@pytest.mark.tryfirst
def pytest_runtest_call():
    ...


# or
def pytest_runtest_call():
    ...


pytest_runtest_call.tryfirst = True
```

should be changed to:

```python
@pytest.hookimpl(tryfirst=True)
def pytest_runtest_call():
    ...
```

Changed `hookimpl` attributes:

- `tryfirst`

- `trylast`

- `optionalhook`

- `hookwrapper`

Changed `hookwrapper` attributes:

- `firstresult`

- `historic`

### `py.path.local` arguments for hooks replaced with `pathlib.Path` {#py-path-local-arguments-for-hooks-replaced-with-pathlib-path}

*Deprecated since version 7.0.*

In order to support the transition from `py.path.local` to `pathlib`, the following hooks now receive additional arguments:

- `pytest_ignore_collect(collection_path: pathlib.Path)` as equivalent to `path`

- `pytest_collect_file(file_path: pathlib.Path)` as equivalent to `path`

- `pytest_pycollect_makemodule(module_path: pathlib.Path)` as equivalent to `path`

- `pytest_report_header(start_path: pathlib.Path)` as equivalent to `startdir`

- `pytest_report_collectionfinish(start_path: pathlib.Path)` as equivalent to `startdir`

The accompanying `py.path.local` based paths have been deprecated: plugins which manually invoke those hooks should only pass the new `pathlib.Path` arguments, and users should change their hook implementations to use the new `pathlib.Path` arguments.

::: tip Note
The name of the `Node` arguments and attributes, [outlined above](/python/pytest/further_topics/deprecation#fspath-argument-for-node-constructors-replaced-with-pathlib-path) (the new attribute being `path`) is the opposite of the situation for hooks (the old argument being `path`).

This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the `py` dependency (see [issue #9283](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9283) for a longer discussion).
:::

### Directly constructing internal classes {#directly-constructing-internal-classes}

*Deprecated since version 7.0.*

Directly constructing the following classes is now deprecated:

- `_pytest.mark.structures.Mark`

- `_pytest.mark.structures.MarkDecorator`

- `_pytest.mark.structures.MarkGenerator`

- `_pytest.python.Metafunc`

- `_pytest.runner.CallInfo`

- `_pytest._code.ExceptionInfo`

- `_pytest.config.argparsing.Parser`

- `_pytest.config.argparsing.OptionGroup`

- `_pytest.pytester.HookRecorder`

These constructors have always been considered private, but now issue a deprecation warning, which may become a hard error in pytest 8.

### Passing `msg=` to `pytest.skip`, `pytest.fail` or `pytest.exit` {#passing-msg-to-pytest-skip-pytest-fail-or-pytest-exit}

*Deprecated since version 7.0.*

Passing the keyword argument `msg` to `pytest.skip()`, `pytest.fail()` or `pytest.exit()` is now deprecated and `reason` should be used instead. This change is to bring consistency between these functions and the `@pytest.mark.skip` and `@pytest.mark.xfail` markers which already accept a `reason` argument.

```python
def test_fail_example():
    # old
    pytest.fail(msg="foo")
    # new
    pytest.fail(reason="bar")


def test_skip_example():
    # old
    pytest.skip(msg="foo")
    # new
    pytest.skip(reason="bar")


def test_exit_example():
    # old
    pytest.exit(msg="foo")
    # new
    pytest.exit(reason="bar")
```

### Implementing the pytest_cmdline_preparse hook {#implementing-the-pytest-cmdline-preparse-hook}

*Deprecated since version 7.0.*

Implementing the `pytest_cmdline_preparse` hook has been officially deprecated. Implement the `pytest_load_initial_conftests` hook instead.


```python
def pytest_cmdline_preparse(config: Config, args: List[str]) -> None:
    ...


# becomes:


def pytest_load_initial_conftests(
    early_config: Config, parser: Parser, args: List[str]
) -> None:
    ...
```

### Diamond inheritance between `pytest.Collector` and `pytest.Item` {#diamond-inheritance-between-pytest-collector-and-pytest-item}

*Deprecated since version 7.0.*

Defining a custom pytest node type which is both an `pytest.Item` and a `pytest.Collector` (e.g. `pytest.File`) now issues a warning. It was never sanely supported and triggers hard to debug errors.

Some plugins providing linting/code analysis have been using this as a hack. Instead, a separate collector node should be used, which collects the item. See [Working with non-python tests](/python/pytest/further_topics/example_trick/work#working-with-non-python-tests) for an example, as well as an [example pr fixing inheritance](https://github.com/asmeurer/pytest-flakes/pull/40/files).

### Constructors of custom `pytest.Node` subclasses should take `**kwargs` {#constructors-of-custom-pytest-node-subclasses-should-take-kwargs}

*Deprecated since version 7.0.*

If custom subclasses of nodes like `pytest.Item` override the `__init__` method, they should take `**kwargs`. Thus,

```python
class CustomItem(pytest.Item):
    def __init__(self, name, parent, additional_arg):
        super().__init__(name, parent)
        self.additional_arg = additional_arg
```

should be turned into:

```python
class CustomItem(pytest.Item):
    def __init__(self, *, additional_arg, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.additional_arg = additional_arg
```

to avoid hard-coding the arguments pytest can pass to the superclass. See [Working with non-python tests](/python/pytest/further_topics/example_trick/work#working-with-non-python-tests) for a full example.

For cases without conflicts, no deprecation warning is emitted. For cases with conflicts (such as `pytest.File` now taking `path` instead of `fspath`, as [outlined above](/python/pytest/further_topics/deprecation#fspath-argument-for-node-constructors-replaced-with-pathlib-path)), a deprecation warning is now raised.

## Applying a mark to a fixture function {#applying-a-mark-to-a-fixture-function}

*Deprecated since version 7.4.*

Applying a mark to a fixture function never had any effect, but it is a common user error.

```python
@pytest.mark.usefixtures("clean_database")
@pytest.fixture
def user() -> User:
    ...
```

Users expected in this case that the `usefixtures` mark would have its intended effect of using the `clean_database` fixture when `user` was invoked, when in fact it has no effect at all.

Now pytest will issue a warning when it encounters this problem, and will raise an error in the future versions.

### Backward compatibilities in `Parser.addoption` {#backward-compatibilities-in-parser-addoption}

*Deprecated since version 2.4.*

Several behaviors of `Parser.addoption` are now scheduled for removal in pytest 8 (deprecated since pytest 2.4.0):

- `parser.addoption(..., help=".. %default ..")` - use `%(default)s` instead.

- `parser.addoption(..., type="int/string/float/complex")` - use `type=int` etc. instead.

### Using `pytest.warns(None)` {#using-pytest-warns-none}

*Deprecated since version 7.0.*

`pytest.warns(None)` is now deprecated because it was frequently misused. Its correct usage was checking that the code emits at least one warning of any type - like `pytest.warns()` or `pytest.warns(Warning)`.

See [Additional use cases of warnings in tests](/python/pytest/how_to_guides/warning#additional-use-cases-of-warnings-in-tests) for examples.

### Returning non-None value in test functions {#returning-non-none-value-in-test-functions}

*Deprecated since version 7.2.*

A `pytest.PytestReturnNotNoneWarning` is now emitted if a test function returns something other than `None`.

This prevents a common mistake among beginners that expect that returning a `bool` would cause a test to pass or fail, for example:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    ["a", "b", "result"],
    [
        [1, 2, 5],
        [2, 3, 8],
        [5, 3, 18],
    ],
)
def test_foo(a, b, result):
    return foo(a, b) == result
```

Given that pytest ignores the return value, this might be surprising that it will never fail.

The proper fix is to change the `return` to an `assert`:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    ["a", "b", "result"],
    [
        [1, 2, 5],
        [2, 3, 8],
        [5, 3, 18],
    ],
)
def test_foo(a, b, result):
    assert foo(a, b) == result
```

### The `--strict` command-line option {#the-strict-command-line-option}

*Deprecated since version 6.2.*

The `--strict` command-line option has been deprecated in favor of `--strict-markers`, which better conveys what the option does.

We have plans to maybe in the future to reintroduce `--strict` and make it an encompassing flag for all strictness related options (`--strict-markers` and `--strict-config` at the moment, more might be introduced in the future).

### The yield_fixture function/decorator {#the-yield-fixture-function-decorator}

*Deprecated since version 6.2.*

`pytest.yield_fixture` is a deprecated alias for `pytest.fixture()`.

It has been so for a very long time, so can be search/replaced safely.

## Removed Features and Breaking Changes {#removed-features-and-breaking-changes}

As stated in our [Backwards Compatibility Policy](/python/pytest/further_topics/compatibility#backwards-compatibility-policy) policy, deprecated features are removed only in major releases after an appropriate period of deprecation has passed.

Some breaking changes which could not be deprecated are also listed.

### Collecting `__init__.py` files no longer collects package {#collecting-init-py-files-no-longer-collects-package}

*Removed in version 8.0.*

Running `pytest pkg/__init__.py` now collects the `pkg/__init__.py` file (module) only. Previously, it collected the entire `pkg` package, including other test files in the directory, but excluding tests in the` __init__.py` file itself (unless `python_files` was changed to allow `__init__.py` file).

To collect the entire package, specify just the directory: `pytest pkg`.

### The `pytest.collect` module {#the-pytest-collect-module}

*Deprecated since version 6.0.*

*Removed in version 7.0.*

The `pytest.collect` module is no longer part of the public API, all its names should now be imported from `pytest` directly instead.

### The pytest_warning_captured hook {#the-pytest-warning-captured-hook}

*Deprecated since version 6.0.*

*Removed in version 7.0.*

This hook has an `item` parameter which cannot be serialized by `pytest-xdist`.

Use the `pytest_warning_recorded` hook instead, which replaces the `item` parameter by a nodeid parameter.

### The `pytest._fillfuncargs` function {#the-pytest-fillfuncargs-function}

*Deprecated since version 6.0.*

*Removed in version 7.0.*

This function was kept for backward compatibility with an older plugin.

Itâ€™s functionality is not meant to be used directly, but if you must replace it, use `function._request._fillfixtures()` instead, though note this is not a public API and may break in the future.

### `--no-print-logs` command-line option {#no-print-logs-command-line-option}

*Deprecated since version 5.4.*

*Removed in version 6.0.*

The `--no-print-logs` option and `log_print` ini setting are removed. If you used them, please use `--show-capture` instead.

A `--show-capture` command-line option was added in `pytest 3.5.0` which allows to specify how to display captured output when tests fail: `no`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `log` or `all` (the default).

### Result log (`--result-log`) {#result-log-result-log}

*Deprecated since version 4.0.*

*Removed in version 6.0.*

The `--result-log` option produces a stream of test reports which can be analysed at runtime, but it uses a custom format which requires users to implement their own parser.

The [pytest-reportlog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog) plugin provides a `--report-log` option, a more standard and extensible alternative, producing one JSON object per-line, and should cover the same use cases. Please try it out and provide feedback.

The `pytest-reportlog` plugin might even be merged into the core at some point, depending on the plans for the plugins and number of users using it.

### pytest_collect_directory hook {#pytest-collect-directory-hook}

*Removed in version 6.0.*

The `pytest_collect_directory` hook has not worked properly for years (it was called but the results were ignored). Users may consider using `pytest_collection_modifyitems` instead.

### TerminalReporter.writer {#terminalreporter-writer}

*Removed in version 6.0.*

The `TerminalReporter.writer` attribute has been deprecated and should no longer be used. This was inadvertently exposed as part of the public API of that plugin and ties it too much with `py.io.TerminalWriter`.

Plugins that used `TerminalReporter.writer` directly should instead use `TerminalReporter` methods that provide the same functionality.

### junit_family default value change to "xunit2" {#junit-family-default-value-change-to-xunit2}

*Changed in version 6.0.*

The default value of `junit_family` option will change to `xunit2` in pytest 6.0, which is an update of the old `xunit1` format and is supported by default in modern tools that manipulate this type of file (for example, Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, etc.).

Users are recommended to try the new `xunit2` format and see if their tooling that consumes the JUnit XML file supports it.

To use the new format, update your `pytest.ini`:

```ini
[pytest]
junit_family=xunit2
```

If you discover that your tooling does not support the new format, and want to keep using the legacy version, set the option to `legacy` instead:

```ini
[pytest]
junit_family=legacy
```

By using `legacy` you will keep using the legacy/xunit1 format when upgrading to pytest 6.0, where the default format will be `xunit2`.

In order to let users know about the transition, pytest will issue a warning in case the `--junitxml` option is given in the command line but `junit_family` is not explicitly configured in `pytest.ini`.

Services known to support the `xunit2` format:

- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) with the [JUnit](https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit) plugin.

- [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines).

### Node Construction changed to `Node.from_parent` {#node-construction-changed-to-node-from-parent}

*Changed in version 6.0.*

The construction of nodes now should use the named constructor `from_parent`. This limitation in api surface intends to enable better/simpler refactoring of the collection tree.

This means that instead of `MyItem(name="foo", parent=collector, obj=42)` one now has to invoke `MyItem.from_parent(collector, name="foo")`.

Plugins that wish to support older versions of pytest and suppress the warning can use `hasattr` to check if `from_parent` exists in that version:

```python
def pytest_pycollect_makeitem(collector, name, obj):
    if hasattr(MyItem, "from_parent"):
        item = MyItem.from_parent(collector, name="foo")
        item.obj = 42
        return item
    else:
        return MyItem(name="foo", parent=collector, obj=42)
```

Note that `from_parent` should only be called with keyword arguments for the parameters.

### `pytest.fixture` arguments are keyword only {#pytest-fixture-arguments-are-keyword-only}

*Removed in version 6.0.*

Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments has been removed - pass them by keyword instead.

### funcargnames alias for fixturenames {#funcargnames-alias-for-fixturenames}

*Removed in version 6.0.*

The `FixtureRequest`, `Metafunc`, and `Function` classes track the names of their associated fixtures, with the aptly-named `fixturenames` attribute.

Prior to pytest 2.3, this attribute was named `funcargnames`, and we have kept that as an alias since. It is finally due for removal, as it is often confusing in places where we or plugin authors must distinguish between fixture names and names supplied by non-fixture things such as `pytest.mark.parametrize`.

### `pytest.config` global {#pytest-config-global}

*Removed in version 5.0.*

The `pytest.config` global object is deprecated. Instead use `request.config` (via the `request` fixture) or if you are a plugin author use the `pytest_configure(config)` hook. Note that many hooks can also access the `config` object indirectly, through `session.config` or `item.config` for example.

### "message" parameter of `pytest.raises` {#message-parameter-of-pytest-raises}

*Removed in version 5.0.*

It is a common mistake to think this parameter will match the exception message, while in fact it only serves to provide a custom message in case the `pytest.raises` check fails. To prevent users from making this mistake, and because it is believed to be little used, pytest is deprecating it without providing an alternative for the moment.

If you have a valid use case for this parameter, consider that to obtain the same results you can just call `pytest.fail` manually at the end of the `with` statement.

For example:

```python
with pytest.raises(TimeoutError, message="Client got unexpected message"):
    wait_for(websocket.recv(), 0.5)
```

Becomes:

```python
with pytest.raises(TimeoutError):
    wait_for(websocket.recv(), 0.5)
    pytest.fail("Client got unexpected message")
```

If you still have concerns about this deprecation and future removal, please comment on [issue #3974](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3974).

### raises / warns with a string as the second argument {#raises-warns-with-a-string-as-the-second-argument}

*Removed in version 5.0.*

Use the context manager form of these instead. When necessary, invoke `exec` directly.

Example:

```python
pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError, "1 / 0")
pytest.raises(SyntaxError, "a $ b")

pytest.warns(DeprecationWarning, "my_function()")
pytest.warns(SyntaxWarning, "assert(1, 2)")
```

Becomes:

```python
with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
    1 / 0
with pytest.raises(SyntaxError):
    exec("a $ b")  # exec is required for invalid syntax

with pytest.warns(DeprecationWarning):
    my_function()
with pytest.warns(SyntaxWarning):
    exec("assert(1, 2)")  # exec is used to avoid a top-level warning
```

### Using Class in custom Collectors {#using-class-in-custom-collectors}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

Using objects named `"Class"` as a way to customize the type of nodes that are collected in `Collector` subclasses has been deprecated. Users instead should use `pytest_pycollect_makeitem` to customize node types during collection.

This issue should affect only advanced plugins who create new collection types, so if you see this warning message please contact the authors so they can change the code.

### marks in `pytest.mark.parametrize` {#marks-in-pytest-mark-parametrize}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

Applying marks to values of a `pytest.mark.parametrize` call is now deprecated. For example:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "a, b",
    [
        (3, 9),
        pytest.mark.xfail(reason="flaky")(6, 36),
        (10, 100),
        (20, 200),
        (40, 400),
        (50, 500),
    ],
)
def test_foo(a, b):
    ...
```

This code applies the `pytest.mark.xfail(reason="flaky")` mark to the `(6, 36)` value of the above parametrization call.

This was considered hard to read and understand, and also its implementation presented problems to the code preventing further internal improvements in the marks architecture.

To update the code, use `pytest.param`:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "a, b",
    [
        (3, 9),
        pytest.param(6, 36, marks=pytest.mark.xfail(reason="flaky")),
        (10, 100),
        (20, 200),
        (40, 400),
        (50, 500),
    ],
)
def test_foo(a, b):
    ...
```

### `pytest_funcarg__` prefix {#pytest-funcarg-prefix}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

In very early pytest versions fixtures could be defined using the `pytest_funcarg__` prefix:

```python
def pytest_funcarg__data():
    return SomeData()
```

Switch over to the `@pytest.fixture` decorator:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def data():
    return SomeData()
```

### `[pytest]` section in `setup.cfg` files {#pytest-section-in-setup-cfg-files}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

`[pytest]` sections in `setup.cfg` files should now be named `[tool:pytest]` to avoid conflicts with other distutils commands.

### Metafunc.addcall {#metafunc-addcall}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

`Metafunc.addcall` was a precursor to the current parametrized mechanism. Users should use `pytest.Metafunc.parametrize()` instead.

Example:

```python
def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):
    metafunc.addcall({"i": 1}, id="1")
    metafunc.addcall({"i": 2}, id="2")
```

Becomes:

```python
def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):
    metafunc.parametrize("i", [1, 2], ids=["1", "2"])
```

### cached_setup {#cached-setup}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

`request.cached_setup` was the precursor of the setup/teardown mechanism available to fixtures.

Example:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def db_session():
    return request.cached_setup(
        setup=Session.create, teardown=lambda session: session.close(), scope="module"
    )
```

This should be updated to make use of standard fixture mechanisms:

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def db_session():
    session = Session.create()
    yield session
    session.close()
```

You can consult [funcarg comparison section in the docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/funcarg_compare.html) for more information.

### pytest_plugins in non-top-level conftest files {#pytest-plugins-in-non-top-level-conftest-files}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

Defining `pytest_plugins` is now deprecated in non-top-level `conftest.py` files because they will activate referenced plugins globally, which is surprising because for all other pytest features `conftest.py` files are only active for tests at or below it.

### `Config.warn` and `Node.warn` {#config-warn-and-node-warn}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

Those methods were part of the internal pytest warnings system, but since 3.8 pytest is using the builtin warning system for its own warnings, so those two functions are now deprecated.

`Config.warn` should be replaced by calls to the standard `warnings.warn`, example:

```python
config.warn("C1", "some warning")
```

Becomes:

```python
warnings.warn(pytest.PytestWarning("some warning"))
```

`Node.warn` now supports two signatures:

- `node.warn(PytestWarning("some message"))`: is now the recommended way to call this function. The warning instance must be a PytestWarning or subclass.

- `node.warn("CI", "some message")`: this code/message form has been removed and should be converted to the warning instance form above.

### record_xml_property {#record-xml-property}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

The `record_xml_property` fixture is now deprecated in favor of the more generic `record_property`, which can be used by other consumers (for example `pytest-html`) to obtain custom information about the test run.

This is just a matter of renaming the fixture as the API is the same:

```python
def test_foo(record_xml_property):
    ...
```

Change to:

```python
def test_foo(record_property):
    ...
```

### Passing command-line string to `pytest.main()` {#passing-command-line-string-to-pytest-main}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

Passing a command-line string to `pytest.main()` is deprecated:

```python
pytest.main("-v -s")
```

Pass a list instead:

```python
pytest.main(["-v", "-s"])
```

By passing a string, users expect that pytest will interpret that command-line using the shell rules they are working on (for example `bash` or `Powershell`), but this is very hard/impossible to do in a portable way.

### Calling fixtures directly {#calling-fixtures-directly}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

Calling a fixture function directly, as opposed to request them in a test function, is deprecated.

For example:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def cell():
    return ...


@pytest.fixture
def full_cell():
    cell = cell()
    cell.make_full()
    return cell
```

This is a great source of confusion to new users, which will often call the fixture functions and request them from test functions interchangeably, which breaks the fixture resolution model.

In those cases just request the function directly in the dependent fixture:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def cell():
    return ...


@pytest.fixture
def full_cell(cell):
    cell.make_full()
    return cell
```

Alternatively if the fixture function is called multiple times inside a test (making it hard to apply the above pattern) or if you would like to make minimal changes to the code, you can create a fixture which calls the original function together with the name parameter:

```python
def cell():
    return ...


@pytest.fixture(name="cell")
def cell_fixture():
    return cell()
```

### yield tests {#yield-tests}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

pytest supported `yield`-style tests, where a test function actually `yield` functions and values that are then turned into proper test methods. Example:

```python
def check(x, y):
    assert x**x == y


def test_squared():
    yield check, 2, 4
    yield check, 3, 9
```

This would result into two actual test functions being generated.

This form of test function doesnâ€™t support fixtures properly, and users should switch to `pytest.mark.parametrize`:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("x, y", [(2, 4), (3, 9)])
def test_squared(x, y):
    assert x**x == y
```

### Internal classes accessed through Node {#internal-classes-accessed-through-node}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

Access of `Module`, `Function`, `Class`, `Instance`, `File` and `Item` through `Node` instances now issue this warning:

::: warning 
usage of `Function.Module` is deprecated, please use `pytest.Module` instead
:::

Users should just `import pytest` and access those objects using the `pytest` module.

This has been documented as deprecated for years, but only now we are actually emitting deprecation warnings.

### Node.get_marker {#node-get-marker}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

As part of a large Marker revamp and iteration,` _pytest.nodes.Node.get_marker` is removed. See [the documentation](/python/pytest/further_topics/historical_note#updating-code) on tips on how to update your code.

### somefunction.markname {#somefunction-markname}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

As part of a large [Marker revamp and iteration](/python/pytest/further_topics/historical_note#marker-revamp-and-iteration) we already deprecated using `MarkInfo` the only correct way to get markers of an element is via `node.iter_markers(name)`.

### pytest_namespace {#pytest-namespace}

*Removed in version 4.0.*

This hook is deprecated because it greatly complicates the pytest internals regarding configuration and initialization, making some bug fixes and refactorings impossible.

Example of usage:

```python
class MySymbol:
    ...


def pytest_namespace():
    return {"my_symbol": MySymbol()}
```

Plugin authors relying on this hook should instead require that users now import the plugin modules directly (with an appropriate public API).

As a stopgap measure, plugin authors may still inject their names into pytestâ€™s namespace, usually during `pytest_configure`:

```python
import pytest


def pytest_configure():
    pytest.my_symbol = MySymbol()
```
