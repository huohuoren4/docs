# pytest: helps you write better programs

::: tip Tip
pytest document version: `7.4.0`. the lastest version is only maintained. 
:::

The `pytest` framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

`pytest` requires: `Python 3.8+` or `PyPy3`.

*PyPI package name*: [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)

## A quick example

```python
# content of test_sample.py
def inc(x):
    return x + 1


def test_answer():
    assert inc(3) == 5
```

To execute it:

```shell
$ pytest
=========================== test session starts ============================
platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-7.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
rootdir: /home/sweet/project
collected 1 item

test_sample.py F                                                     [100%]

================================= FAILURES =================================
_______________________________ test_answer ________________________________

    def test_answer():
>       assert inc(3) == 5
E       assert 4 == 5
E        +  where 4 = inc(3)

test_sample.py:6: AssertionError
========================= short test summary info ==========================
FAILED test_sample.py::test_answer - assert 4 == 5
============================ 1 failed in 0.12s =============================
```

Due to `pytest`â€™s detailed assertion introspection, only plain `assert` statements are used. See [Get started](/python/pytest/get_started) for a basic introduction to using pytest.
