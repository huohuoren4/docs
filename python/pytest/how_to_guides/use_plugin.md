# How to install and use plugins

This section talks about installing and using third party plugins. For writing your own plugins, please refer to Writing plugins.

Installing a third party plugin can be easily done with `pip`:

```shell
pip install pytest-NAME
pip uninstall pytest-NAME
```

If a plugin is installed, `pytest` automatically finds and integrates it, there is no need to activate it.

Here is a little annotated list for some popular plugins:

- pytest-django: write tests for django apps, using pytest integration.

- pytest-twisted: write tests for twisted apps, starting a reactor and processing deferreds from test functions.

- pytest-cov: coverage reporting, compatible with distributed testing

- pytest-xdist: to distribute tests to CPUs and remote hosts, to run in boxed mode which allows to survive segmentation faults, to run in looponfailing mode, automatically re-running failing tests on file changes.

- pytest-instafail: to report failures while the test run is happening.

- pytest-bdd: to write tests using behaviour-driven testing.

- pytest-timeout: to timeout tests based on function marks or global definitions.

- pytest-pep8: a --pep8 option to enable PEP8 compliance checking.

- pytest-flakes: check source code with pyflakes.

- allure-pytest: report test results via allure-framework.

To see a complete list of all plugins with their latest testing status against different pytest and Python versions, please visit Plugin List.

You may also discover more plugins through a pytest- pypi.org search.

## Requiring/Loading plugins in a test module or conftest file

You can require plugins in a test module or a conftest file using pytest_plugins:

```python
pytest_plugins = ("myapp.testsupport.myplugin",)
```

When the test module or conftest plugin is loaded the specified plugins will be loaded as well.

::: tip Note
Requiring plugins using a `pytest_plugins` variable in non-root `conftest.py` files is deprecated. See full explanation in the Writing plugins section.
:::

::: tip Note
The name `pytest_plugins` is reserved and should not be used as a name for a custom plugin module.

## Finding out which plugins are active

If you want to find out which plugins are active in your environment you can type:

```shell
pytest --trace-config
```

and will get an extended test header which shows activated plugins and their names. It will also print local plugins aka conftest.py files when they are loaded.

## Deactivating / unregistering a plugin by name

You can prevent plugins from loading or unregister them:

```shell
pytest -p no:NAME
```

This means that any subsequent try to activate/load the named plugin will not work.

If you want to unconditionally disable a plugin for a project, you can add this option to your `pytest.ini` file:

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = -p no:NAME
```

Alternatively to disable it only in certain environments (for example in a CI server), you can set `PYTEST_ADDOPTS` environment variable to `-p no:name`.

See Finding out which plugins are active for how to obtain the name of a plugin.
