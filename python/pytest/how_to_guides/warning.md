# How to capture warnings

Starting from version `3.1`, pytest now automatically catches warnings during test execution and displays them at the end of the session:

```python
# content of test_show_warnings.py
import warnings


def api_v1():
    warnings.warn(UserWarning("api v1, should use functions from v2"))
    return 1


def test_one():
    assert api_v1() == 1
```

Running pytest now produces this output:

```shell
$ pytest test_show_warnings.py
=========================== test session starts ============================

## Controlling warnings

Similar to Python’s warning filter and -W option flag, pytest provides its own -W flag to control which warnings are ignored, displayed, or turned into errors. See the warning filter documentation for more advanced use-cases.

This code sample shows how to treat any `UserWarning` category class of warning as an error:

```shell
$ pytest -q test_show_warnings.py -W error::UserWarning
F                                                                    [100%]
================================= FAILURES =================================
_________________________________ test_one _________________________________

    def test_one():
>       assert api_v1() == 1

test_show_warnings.py:10:
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

    def api_v1():
>       warnings.warn(UserWarning("api v1, should use functions from v2"))
E       UserWarning: api v1, should use functions from v2

test_show_warnings.py:5: UserWarning
========================= short test summary info ==========================
FAILED test_show_warnings.py::test_one - UserWarning: api v1, should use ...
1 failed in 0.12s
```

The same option can be set in the `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` file using the `filterwarnings` ini option. For example, the configuration below will ignore all user warnings and specific deprecation warnings matching a regex, but will transform all other warnings into errors.

```ini
# pytest.ini
[pytest]
filterwarnings =
    error
    ignore::UserWarning
    ignore:function ham\(\) is deprecated:DeprecationWarning
```

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
filterwarnings = [
    "error",
    "ignore::UserWarning",
    # note the use of single quote below to denote "raw" strings in TOML
    'ignore:function ham\(\) is deprecated:DeprecationWarning',
]
```

When a warning matches more than one option in the list, the action for the last matching option is performed.

::: tip Note
The -W flag and the `filterwarnings` ini option use warning filters that are similar in structure, but each configuration option interprets its filter differently. For example, message in `filterwarnings` is a string containing a regular expression that the start of the warning message must match, case-insensitively, while message in `-W` is a literal string that the start of the warning message must contain (case-insensitively), ignoring any whitespace at the start or end of message. Consult the warning filter documentation for more details.

## @pytest.mark.filterwarnings

You can use the `@pytest.mark.filterwarnings` to add warning filters to specific test items, allowing you to have finer control of which warnings should be captured at test, class or even module level:

```python
import warnings


def api_v1():
    warnings.warn(UserWarning("api v1, should use functions from v2"))
    return 1


@pytest.mark.filterwarnings("ignore:api v1")
def test_one():
    assert api_v1() == 1
```

Filters applied using a mark take precedence over filters passed on the command line or configured by the `filterwarnings` ini option.

You may apply a filter to all tests of a class by using the `filterwarnings` mark as a class decorator or to all tests in a module by setting the pytestmark variable:

```python
# turns all warnings into errors for this module
pytestmark = pytest.mark.filterwarnings("error")
```

*Credits go to Florian Schulze for the reference implementation in the pytest-warnings plugin.*

## Disabling warnings summary

Although not recommended, you can use the `--disable-warnings` command-line option to suppress the warning summary entirely from the test run output.

## Disabling warning capture entirely

This plugin is enabled by default but can be disabled entirely in your `pytest.ini` file with:

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = -p no:warnings
```

Or passing `-p no:warnings` in the command-line. This might be useful if your test suites handles warnings using an external system.

## DeprecationWarning and PendingDeprecationWarning

By default pytest will display `DeprecationWarning` and `PendingDeprecationWarning` warnings from user code and third-party libraries, as recommended by PEP 565. This helps users keep their code modern and avoid breakages when deprecated warnings are effectively removed.

However, in the specific case where users capture any type of warnings in their test, either with pytest.warns(), pytest.deprecated_call() or using the recwarn fixture, no warning will be displayed at all.

Sometimes it is useful to hide some specific deprecation warnings that happen in code that you have no control over (such as third-party libraries), in which case you might use the warning filters options (ini or marks) to ignore those warnings.

For example:

```ini
[pytest]
filterwarnings =
    ignore:.*U.*mode is deprecated:DeprecationWarning
```

This will ignore all warnings of type `DeprecationWarning` where the start of the message matches the regular expression `".*U.*mode is deprecated"`.

See @pytest.mark.filterwarnings and Controlling warnings for more examples.

::: tip Note
If warnings are configured at the interpreter level, using the PYTHONWARNINGS environment variable or the `-W` command-line option, pytest will not configure any filters by default.

Also pytest doesn’t follow PEP 506 suggestion of resetting all warning filters because it might break test suites that configure warning filters themselves by calling warnings.simplefilter() (see issue #2430 for an example of that).
:::

## Ensuring code triggers a deprecation warning

You can also use pytest.deprecated_call() for checking that a certain function call triggers a `DeprecationWarning` or `PendingDeprecationWarning`:

```python
import pytest


def test_myfunction_deprecated():
    with pytest.deprecated_call():
        myfunction(17)
```

This test will fail if `myfunction` does not issue a deprecation warning when called with a `17` argument.

## Asserting warnings with the warns function

You can check that code raises a particular warning using pytest.warns(), which works in a similar manner to raises (except that raises does not capture all exceptions, only the `expected_exception`):

```python
import warnings

import pytest


def test_warning():
    with pytest.warns(UserWarning):
        warnings.warn("my warning", UserWarning)
```

The test will fail if the warning in question is not raised. Use the keyword argument `match` to assert that the warning matches a text or regex. To match a literal string that may contain regular expression metacharacters like `(` or `.`, the pattern can first be escaped with `re.escape`.

Some examples:

```shell
with warns(UserWarning, match="must be 0 or None"):
    warnings.warn("value must be 0 or None", UserWarning)


with warns(UserWarning, match=r"must be \d+$"):
    warnings.warn("value must be 42", UserWarning)


with warns(UserWarning, match=r"must be \d+$"):
    warnings.warn("this is not here", UserWarning)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
Failed: DID NOT WARN. No warnings of type ...UserWarning... were emitted...

with warns(UserWarning, match=re.escape("issue with foo() func")):
    warnings.warn("issue with foo() func")
```

You can also call pytest.warns() on a function or code string:

```python
pytest.warns(expected_warning, func, *args, **kwargs)
pytest.warns(expected_warning, "func(*args, **kwargs)")
```

The function also returns a list of all raised warnings (as `warnings.WarningMessage` objects), which you can query for additional information:

```python
with pytest.warns(RuntimeWarning) as record:
    warnings.warn("another warning", RuntimeWarning)

# check that only one warning was raised
assert len(record) == 1
# check that the message matches
assert record[0].message.args[0] == "another warning"
```

Alternatively, you can examine raised warnings in detail using the recwarn fixture (see below).

The recwarn fixture automatically ensures to reset the warnings filter at the end of the test, so no global state is leaked.

## Recording warnings

You can record raised warnings either using pytest.warns() or with the `recwarn` fixture.

To record with pytest.warns() without asserting anything about the warnings, pass no arguments as the expected warning type and it will default to a generic Warning:

```python
with pytest.warns() as record:
    warnings.warn("user", UserWarning)
    warnings.warn("runtime", RuntimeWarning)

assert len(record) == 2
assert str(record[0].message) == "user"
assert str(record[1].message) == "runtime"
```

The recwarn fixture will record warnings for the whole function:

```python
import warnings


def test_hello(recwarn):
    warnings.warn("hello", UserWarning)
    assert len(recwarn) == 1
    w = recwarn.pop(UserWarning)
    assert issubclass(w.category, UserWarning)
    assert str(w.message) == "hello"
    assert w.filename
    assert w.lineno
```

Both `recwarn` and pytest.warns() return the same interface for recorded warnings: a WarningsRecorder instance. To view the recorded warnings, you can iterate over this instance, call `len` on it to get the number of recorded warnings, or index into it to get a particular recorded warning.

Full API: WarningsRecorder.

## Additional use cases of warnings in tests

Here are some use cases involving warnings that often come up in tests, and suggestions on how to deal with them:

- To ensure that at least one of the indicated warnings is issued, use:

```python
def test_warning():
    with pytest.warns((RuntimeWarning, UserWarning)):
        ...
```

To ensure that only certain warnings are issued, use:

```python
def test_warning(recwarn):
    ...
    assert len(recwarn) == 1
    user_warning = recwarn.pop(UserWarning)
    assert issubclass(user_warning.category, UserWarning)
```

To ensure that no warnings are emitted, use:

```python
def test_warning():
    with warnings.catch_warnings():
        warnings.simplefilter("error")
        ...
```

To suppress warnings, use:

```python
with warnings.catch_warnings():
    warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
    ...
```

## Custom failure messages

Recording warnings provides an opportunity to produce custom test failure messages for when no warnings are issued or other conditions are met.

```python
def test():
    with pytest.warns(Warning) as record:
        f()
        if not record:
            pytest.fail("Expected a warning!")
```

If no warnings are issued when calling f, then `not record` will evaluate to `True`. You can then call pytest.fail() with a custom error message.

## Internal pytest warnings

pytest may generate its own warnings in some situations, such as improper usage or deprecated features.

For example, pytest will emit a warning if it encounters a class that matches python_classes but also defines an `__init__` constructor, as this prevents the class from being instantiated:

```python
# content of test_pytest_warnings.py
class Test:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def test_foo(self):
        assert 1 == 1
```

```shell
$ pytest test_pytest_warnings.py -q

============================= warnings summary =============================
test_pytest_warnings.py:1
  /home/sweet/project/test_pytest_warnings.py:1: PytestCollectionWarning: cannot collect test class 'Test' because it has a __init__ constructor (from: test_pytest_warnings.py)
    class Test:

-- Docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/capture-warnings.html
1 warning in 0.12s
```

These warnings might be filtered using the same builtin mechanisms used to filter other types of warnings.

Please read our Backwards Compatibility Policy to learn how we proceed about deprecating and eventually removing features.

The full list of warnings is listed in the reference documentation.

## Resource Warnings

Additional information of the source of a ResourceWarning can be obtained when captured by pytest if tracemalloc module is enabled.

One convenient way to enable tracemalloc when running tests is to set the PYTHONTRACEMALLOC to a large enough number of frames (say `20`, but that number is application dependent).

For more information, consult the Python Development Mode section in the Python documentation.
