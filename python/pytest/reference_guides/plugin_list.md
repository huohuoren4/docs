# Plugin List

PyPI projects that match “pytest-*” are considered plugins and are listed automatically together with a manually-maintained list in the [source code](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/scripts/update-plugin-list.py). Packages classified as inactive are excluded.

This list contains 1267 [plugins](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/reference/plugin_list.html).
